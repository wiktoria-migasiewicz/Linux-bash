## About the project
Lists of tasks to perform using Bash in the Linux environment with solutions performed by me last semester in my Operating Systems class.

## Usage
Project can be used in practical way to learn and practice various aspects of shell scripting in a Unix/Linux environment, understanding how to write shell scripts to automate tasks.


## Individual Tasks
**1.** Learning how to create, move, copy, rename, and delete **directories** and **files** using shell scripts.

**2.** Understanding the differences between **symbolic and hard links**, and how to create them. **Working with paths** to locate and manipulate files and directories within the file system.

**3.** Performing **operations on text files** such as displaying file encoding, counting lines and characters, and displaying specific lines. **Setting permissions** for files and directories to restrict or allow access.

**4.** Practical use of the **'find' command** and working with multiple **arguments**.

**5.** Learning about hexadecimal and floating-point **number formats** and how to identify them using regular expressions. Implementing basic **validation** rules.

**6.** Understanding how to **set limits** on system resources to prevent system hangs or crashes due to resource exhaustion. Learning how to **define and implement functions**.

**7.** Learning how to create and manipulate **arrays**, including accessing array elements and iterating over array elements. Implementing **sorting algorithms** such as bubble sort manually.

**8.** Understanding how to **read from and write to files**. Implementing robust **error handling** mechanisms to check for permissions, file existence, and directory validity, also providing appropriate error messages.

**9.** Processing text data from a file, including **parsing words** based on specified delimiters. **Formatting** the output. Utilizing associative arrays.
